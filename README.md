*What makes a video trendy or viral? A study into the features of and factors behind such phenomenon*  

Team Members: Georges Linel, Elisa Valentin, Philippine Coutau, Carla Barleaza, Jorge Perez 
 
Context and motivation 
YouTube is one of the most successful platforms for visual entertainment ever. With no requirements for uploading, there are thousands of videos uploaded every day surrounding thousands of different themes. Because of this, the phenomenon of viral videos arose with certain uploads reaching millions of views in a matter of minutes.  Though one would expect trending to go hand in hand with viral, it has been found that the trending page doesn’t always show the viral videos. Therefore, we thought it would be interesting to investigate viral videos as well as trending videos in both the rise of internet and YouTube between 2006-2011 as well as more recently 2017-2018.  

We are looking to explore the video preferences of different audiences across countries (depending on the full extent of database availability), as well as the potential factors that make a video trending or viral. We will also look at the evolution of YouTube videos viewing habits depending on internet availability.
