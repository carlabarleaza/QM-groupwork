Where we post and edit our bibliographies (approx 200 words) 

Franco-argentinian, BAScer, the key word of my degree is 'interdisciplinary', which I'm also keen to apply to myself !
While they don't reflect the entirety of my interests, some of the modules I took this year include social theory, introduction to law,microeconomics, interdisciplinary research methods, moral
philosophy, human geography and mandarin.Before UCL, I studied in a french international school near Paris. 
I am passionate about finding solutions to the challenges posed by climate change and inequality, as well as to the multiple of issues that arise at their intersection. Causes that drive me include the
protection of human rights, in all its forms but particularly that of refugees. I have also been involved in sustainability projects and tutoring (for high school students and refugees).
I also like to read and learn about a variety of topics related to social justice. While my career orientation is not definite, I have a special interest in entrepreneurship
(particularly social) and innovation, the voluntary sector and research. I love learning languages: French and Spanish are my mother tongues and I have been learning
Mandarin for 8 years and Italian for 4. I see languages as a window into a culture, so I like tocomplement my academic learning by reading, listening to podcasts and watching shows in the
language. I have also played guitar for 9 years, for the pleasure mostly and I am a former girl scout.
My favourite veggie has to be sweet potatoe =)
