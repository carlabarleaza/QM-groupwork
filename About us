Where we post and edit our bibliographies (approx 200 words) 

Franco-argentinian, happy BAScer, the key word of my degree is 'interdisciplinarity'. While they don't reflect the entirety of my interests, some of the modules I take include social theory, geography, political sciences, data science, and mandarin.  
I am passionate about finding solutions to the challenges posed by climate change and inequality, as well as to the multiple of issues that arise at their intersection. Causes that drive me include the
protection of human rights, particularly those of refugees. Some of my favourite YT channels: SpecialbooksbySpecialkids, Squirmy and Grubs and The Skin Deep.

I am Philippine, also a BASc student studying a wide range of different subjects. This year, I chose a mix of environment related courses, 
as well as anthropology, philosophy and politics modules. I am still quite unsure about what I want to do later, 
so I am exploring a bit of everything I like! I come from Switzerland where I lived most of my live, in Geneva, before coming to UCL.
One of my favorite YouTube channels is Tracks.
